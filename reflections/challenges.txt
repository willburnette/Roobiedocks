I hve been taking different courses to learn Ruby on Rails for about 2 years now, I can build and deploy a basic app. I am really just taking this course to try and catch any details that I am not proficient in, and as a refresher. Am I wasting my time?

The things that I think I need to concentrate on is the ruby programing, and databases. Is there a differnt Udacity course that would be better for me to take? What skill level will the Ruby on Rails Developer be for when it comes out?
